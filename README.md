---------------------------------------------------------------
# 1. Introduction
---------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the scrips for installing a Watson AIOps demo environment with an Ansible based installer.

They have been ported over from the shell scripts here [https://github.ibm.com/NIKH/aiops-3.1](https://github.ibm.com/NIKH/aiops-3.1).

As of 3.2 and going forward I will only update the Ansible scripts in this repository.


This is provided `as-is`:

* I'm sure there are errors
* I'm sure it's not complete
* It clearly can be improved


**❗This has been tested for the new CP4WAIOPS 3.2 release on OpenShift 4.7 and 4.8.**

**I have tested on ROKS 4.7 and 4.8 and Fyre 4.6 and the scripts run to completion.**

**❗ Then EventManager/NOI-->AI Manager Gateway is not working yet on ROKS**

So please if you have any feedback contact me 

- on Slack: Niklaus Hirt or
- by Mail: nikh@ch.ibm.com


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



---------------------------------------------------------------
# 🐥 2. Easy Install
---------------------------------------------------------------

I have provided a tool to very easily install the different components.

Please follow this chapter and execute all steps marked with 🟢.


## 2.1. Get the code 🟢

Clone the GitHub Repository


```
git clone https://<YOUR GIT TOKEN>@github.ibm.com/NIKH/aiops-install-ansible.git 
```


## 2.2. Prerequisites 

### 2.2.1 OpenShift requirements 🟢

I installed the demo in a ROKS environment.

You'll need:

- ROKS 4.8 (4.6 should work also)
- 5x worker nodes Flavor `b3c.16x64` (so 16 CPU / 64 GB) 

You might get away with less if you don't install some components (Event Manager, Humio, Turbonomic,...):

- Typically 3x worker nodes Flavor `b3c.16x64` _**for only AI Manager**_

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2.2 Tooling 🟢

You need the following tools installed in order to follow through this guide:

- ansible
- oc (4.7 or greater)
- jq
- kafkacat (only for training and debugging)
- elasticdump (only for training and debugging)
- IBM cloudctl (only for LDAP)



#### 2.2.1 On Mac - Automated (preferred) 🟢

Use Option 🐥`81` in [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) to install the `Prerequisites for Mac`

#### 2.2.2 On Mac - Automated (preferred) 🟢

Use Option 🐥`82` in [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) to install the `Prerequisites for Ubuntu`



## 2.3. Get the CP4WAIOPS installation token 🟢

You can get the installation (pull) token from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the CP4WAIOPS images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

![K8s CNI](./doc/pics/tool4.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


---------------------------------------------------------------
# 3. Architecture
---------------------------------------------------------------


## 3.1 Basic Architecture

The environement (Kubernetes, Applications, ...) create logs that are being fed into a Log Management Tool (Humio in this case).

![](./doc/pics/aiops-demo.png)

1. External Systems generate Alerts and send them into the EventManager (Netcool Operations Insight), which in turn sends them to the AI Manager for Event Grouping.
1. At the same time AI Manager ingests the raw logs coming from the Log Management Tool (Humio) and looks for anomalies in the stream based on the trained model.
1. If it finds an anomaly it forwards it to the Event Grouping as well.
1. Out of this, AI Manager creates a Story that is being enriched with Topology (Localization and Blast Radius) and with Similar Incidents that might help correct the problem.
1. The Story is then sent to Slack.
1. A Runbook is available to correct the problem but not launched automatically.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3.2 Optimized Demo Architecture

![](./doc/pics/aiops-demo3.png)

For the this specific Demo environment:

* Humio is not needed as I am using pre-canned logs for training and for the anomaly detection (inception)
* The Events are also created from pre-canned content that is injected into AI Manager
* There are also pre-canned ServiceNow Incidents if you don’t want to do the live integration with SNOW
* The Webpages that are reachable from the Events are static and hosted on my GitHub
* The same goes for ServiceNow Incident pages if you don’t integrate with live SNOW

This allows us to:

* Install the whole Demo Environment in a self-contained OCP Cluster
* Trigger the Anomalies reliably
* Get Events from sources that would normally not be available (Instana, Turbonomic, Metrics Manager, ...)
* Show some examples of SNOW integration without a live system


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


---------------------------------------------------------------
# 4. Configure Applications and Topology
---------------------------------------------------------------



## 4.1 Create Kubernetes Observer for the Demo Applications 🟢

Do this for your applications (RobotShop by default)

* In the `AI Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Operate`/`Data and tool integrations`
* Click `Add connection`
* Under `Kubernetes`, click on `Add Integration`
* Click `Connect`
* Name it `RobotShop`
* Data Center `demo`
* Click `Next`
* Choose `local` for Connection Type
* Set `Hide pods that have been terminated` to `On`
* Set `Correlate analytics events on the namespace groups created by this job` to `On`
* Set Namespace to `robot-shop`
* Click `Next`
* Click `Done`




## 4.2 Create REST Observer to Load Topologies 🟢

* In the `AI Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Operate`/`Data and tool integrations`
* Click `Add connection`
* On the left click on `Topology`
* On the top right click on `You can also configure, schedule, and manage other observer jobs` 
* Click on  `Add a new Job`
* Select `REST`/ `Configure`
* Choose “bulk_replace”
* Set Unique ID to “listenJob” (important!)
* Set Provider to whatever you like (usually I set it to “listenJob” as well)
* `Save`







<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.3 🐥 Create Topology 🟢

##### Use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) - Option `51` for creating the Robot-Shop topology or use the manual procedure in chapter 4.5. 


❗ Please manually re-run the Kubernetes Observer to make sure that the merge has been done.

## 4.4 Create AIOps Application 🟢

#### Robotshop

* In the `AI Manager` go into `Operate` / `Application Management` 
* Click `Define Application`
* Select `robot-shop` namespace
* Click `Next`
* Click `Next`
* Name your Application (RobotShop)
* If you like check `Mark as favorite`
* Click `Define Application`


### 🟢 🚀 Next [Train the Models](#51--training-)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4.5 Manually create Topology (Optional)

Only do this if you don't want to use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install)

### 4.5.1 Create Merge Rules for Kubernetes Observer

Launch the following:

```bash
./51_load_robotshop_topology_aimanager.sh
```

This will create:

- Merge Rules
- Merge Topologies for RobotShop.

❗ Please manually re-run the Kubernetes Observer to make sure that the merge has been done.



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# 5. Training
---------------------------------------------------------------



## 5.1 🐥 Training 🟢


#### Use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) - Option `55` to automatically:
- Load the training data
- Create the training definitions
- Launch the trainings

This will be done for:

- Log Anomaly Detection (Logs)
- Temporal Grouping (Events)
- Similar Incidents (Service Now)
- Change Risk (Service Now)

or use the procedure in [Chapter 22](#22-manually-train-the-models) to do this manually. 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 5.2 Create Integrations 🟢

### 5.2.1 Create Kafka Humio Log Training Integration 🟢

* In the `AI Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Define`/`Data and tool integrations`

	"timestamp_field": "@timestamp"
	}
	```
* Click `Next`
* Toggle `Data Flow` to the `ON` position
* Select `Live data for continuous AI training and anomaly detection`
* Click `Save`


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.2.2 Create Kafka Netcool Training Integration 🟢

* Click `Add connection`
* Under `Kafka`, click on `Add Integration`
* Click `Connect`
* Name it `EvetnManager`
* Click `Next`
* Select `Data Source` / `Events`
* Select `Mapping Type` / `NOI`
* Click `Next`
* Toggle `Data Flow` to the `ON` position
* Click `Save`

### 🟢 🚀 Next [Setup Slack](#61-initial-slack-setup-)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


---------------------------------------------------------------
# 6. Slack integration
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 6.1 Initial Slack Setup 🟢

For the system to work you need to setup your own secure gateway and slack workspace. It is suggested that you do this within the public slack so that you can invite the customer to the experience as well. It also makes it easier for is to release this image to Business partners

You will need to create your own workspace to connect to your instance of CP4WAOps.

Here are the steps to follow:

1. [Create Slack Workspace](./doc/slack/1_slack_workspace.md)
1. [Create Slack App](./doc/slack/2_slack_app_create.md)
1. [Create Slack Channels](./doc/slack/3_slack_channel.md)
1. [Create Slack Integration](./doc/slack/4_slack_integrate.md)
1. [Get the Integration URL - Public Cloud - ROKS](./doc/slack/5_slack_url_public.md) OR 
1. [Get the Integration URL - Private Cloud - Fyre/TEC](./doc/slack/5_slack_url_private.md)
1. [Create Slack App Communications](./doc/slack/6_slack_app_integration.md)
1. [Prepare Slack Reset](./doc/slack/7_slack_reset.md)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 6.2 Create valid CP4WAIOPS Certificate 🟢


In order for Slack integration to work, there must be a signed certicate on the NGNIX pods. The default certificate is self-signed and Slack will not accept that. The method for updating the certificate has changed between AIOps v2.1 and V3.1.1. The NGNIX pods in V3.1.1 mount the certificate through a secret called `external-tls-secret` and that takes precedent over the certificates staged under `/user-home/_global_/customer-certs/`.

For customer deployments, it is required for the customer to provide their own signed certificates. An easy workaround for this is to use the Openshift certificate when deploying on ROKS. **Caveat**: The CA signed certificate used by Openshift is automatically cycled by ROKS (I think every 90 days), so you will need to repeat the below once the existing certificate is expired and possibly reconfigure Slack.



This method replaces the existing secret/certificate with the one that OpenShift ingress uses, not altering the NGINX deployment. An important note, these instructions are for configuring the certificate post-install. Best practice is to follow the installation instructions for configuring certificates during that time.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 6.2.1 Patch AutomationUIConfig

The custom resource `AutomationUIConfig/iaf-system` controls the certificates and the NGINX pods that use those certificates. Any direct update to the certificates or pods will eventually get overwritten, unless you first reconfigure `iaf-system`. It's a bit tricky post-install as you will have to recreate the `iaf-system` resource quickly after deleting it, or else the installation operator will recreate it. For this reason it's important to run all the commands one after the other. **Ensure that you are in the project for AIOps**, then paste all the code on your command line to replace the `iaf-system` resource.

```bash
NAMESPACE=$(oc project -q)
IAF_STORAGE=$(oc get AutomationUIConfig -n $NAMESPACE -o jsonpath='{ .items[*].spec.storage.class }')
oc get -n $NAMESPACE AutomationUIConfig iaf-system -oyaml > iaf-system-backup.yaml
oc delete -n $NAMESPACE AutomationUIConfig iaf-system
cat <<EOF | oc apply -f -
apiVersion: core.automation.ibm.com/v1beta1
kind: AutomationUIConfig
metadata:
  name: iaf-system
  namespace: $NAMESPACE
spec:
  description: AutomationUIConfig for cp4waiops
  license:
    accept: true
  version: v1.0
  storage:
    class: $IAF_STORAGE
  tls:
    caSecret:
      key: ca.crt
      secretName: external-tls-secret
    certificateSecret:
      secretName: external-tls-secret
EOF
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 6.2.2 NGNIX Certificate

Again, **ensure that you are in the project for AIOps** and run the following to replace the existing secret with a secret containing the OpenShift ingress certificate.

```bash
WAIOPS_NAMESPACE =$(oc project -q)
# collect certificate from OpenShift ingress
ingress_pod=$(oc get secrets -n openshift-ingress | grep tls | grep -v router-metrics-certs-default | awk '{print $1}')
oc get secret -n openshift-ingress -o 'go-template={{index .data "tls.crt"}}' ${ingress_pod} | base64 -d > cert.crt
oc get secret -n openshift-ingress -o 'go-template={{index .data "tls.key"}}' ${ingress_pod} | base64 -d > cert.key
oc get secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE iaf-system-automationui-aui-zen-ca -o 'go-template={{index .data "ca.crt"}}'| base64 -d > ca.crt
# backup existing secret
oc get secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE external-tls-secret -o yaml > external-tls-secret$(date +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S).yaml
# delete existing secret
oc delete secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE external-tls-secret
# create new secret
oc create secret generic -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE external-tls-secret --from-file=ca.crt=ca.crt --from-file=cert.crt=cert.crt --from-file=cert.key=cert.key --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
#oc create secret generic -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE external-tls-secret --from-file=cert.crt=cert.crt --from-file=cert.key=cert.key --dry-run=client -o yaml | oc apply -f -
# scale down nginx
REPLICAS=2
oc scale Deployment/ibm-nginx --replicas=0
# scale up nginx
sleep 3
oc scale Deployment/ibm-nginx --replicas=${REPLICAS}
rm external-tls-secret
```


Wait for the nginx pods to come back up

```bash
oc get pods -l component=ibm-nginx
```

When the integration is running, remove the backup file

```bash
rm ./iaf-system-backup.yaml
```

And then restart the Slack integration Pod

```bash
oc delete pod $(oc get po -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE|grep slack|awk '{print$1}') -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE --grace-period 0 --force
```

The last few lines scales down the NGINX pods and scales them back up. It takes about 3 minutes for the pods to fully come back up.

Once those pods have come back up, you can verify the certificate is secure by logging in to AIOps. Note that the login page is not part of AIOps, but rather part of Foundational Services. So you will have to login first and then check that the certificate is valid once logged in. If you want to update the certicate for Foundational Services you can find instructions [here](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/cpfs?topic=operator-replacing-foundational-services-endpoint-certificates).

### 🟢 🚀 Next [Configure LDAP Logins](#71-add-ldap-logins-to-cp4waiops-)

## 6.3 Change the Slack Slash Welcome Message (optional)

If you want to change the welcome message

```bash
oc set env deployment/$(oc get deploy -l app.kubernetes.io/component=chatops-slack-integrator -o jsonpath='{.items[*].metadata.name }') SLACK_WELCOME_COMMAND_NAME=/aiops-help
```


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# 7. Some Polishing
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 7.1 Add LDAP Logins to CP4WAIOPS 🟢


* Go to `AI Manager` Dashboard
* Click on the top left "Hamburger" menu
* Select `User Management`
* Select `User Groups` Tab
* Click `New User Group`
* Enter demo (or whatever you like)
* Click Next
* Select `LDAP Groups`
* Search for `demo`
* Select `cn=demo,ou=Groups,dc=ibm,dc=com`
* Click Next
* Select Roles (I use Administrator for the demo environment)
* Click Next
* Click Create

### 🟢 🚀 Back to [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# 8. Demo the Solution
---------------------------------------------------------------



## 8.1 Simulate incident

**Make sure you are logged-in to the Kubernetes Cluster first** 

In the terminal type 

```bash
./tools/01_demo/incident_robotshop.sh
```

This will delete all existing Alerts and inject pre-canned event and logs to create a story.

ℹ️  Give it a minute or two for all events and anomalies to arrive in Slack.




<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------

# 9. TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 9.1 Check with script

❗ There is a new script that can help you automate some common problems in your CP4WAIOPS installation.

Just run:

```
./tools/10_debug_install.sh
```

and select `Option 1`


## 9.2 Pods in Crashloop

If the evtmanager-topology-merge and/or evtmanager-ibm-hdm-analytics-dev-inferenceservice are crashlooping, apply the following patches. I have only seen this happen on ROKS.

```bash
export WAIOPS_NAMESPACE=cp4waiops

oc patch deployment evtmanager-topology-merge -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE --patch-file ./yaml/waiops/pazch/topology-merge-patch.yaml


oc patch deployment evtmanager-ibm-hdm-analytics-dev-inferenceservice -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE --patch-file ./yaml/waiops/patch/evtmanager-inferenceservice-patch.yaml
```


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 9.3 Pods with Pull Error

If the ir-analytics or cassandra job pods are having pull errors, apply the following patches. 

```bash
export WAIOPS_NAMESPACE=cp4waiops

kubectl patch -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE serviceaccount aiops-topology-service-account -p '{"imagePullSecrets": [{"name": "ibm-entitlement-key"}]}'

## 9.5 Slack integration not working

See [here](#ngnix-certificate-for-v31---if-the-integration-is-not-working)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



## 9.6 Check if data is flowing

### 9.6.1 Check Log injection

To check if logs are being injected through the demo script:

1. Launch 

	```bash
	./tools/22_monitor_kafka.sh
	```
2. Select option 4

You should see data coming in.

### 9.6.2 Check Events injection

To check if events are being injected through the demo script:

1. Launch 

	```bash
	./tools/22_monitor_kafka.sh
	```
2. Select option 3

You should see data coming in.

### 9.6.3 Check Stories being generated

To check if stories are being generated:

1. Launch 

	```bash
	./tools/22_monitor_kafka.sh
	```
2. Select option 2

You should see data being generated.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 9.7 Docker Pull secret

####  ❗⚠️ Make a copy of the secret before modifying 
####  ❗⚠️ On ROKS (any version) and before 4.7 you have to restart the worker nodes after the modification  

We learnt this the hard way...

```bash
oc get secret -n openshift-config pull-secret -oyaml > pull-secret_backup.yaml
```

or more elegant

```bash
oc get Secret -n openshift-config pull-secret -ojson | jq 'del(.metadata.annotations, .metadata.creationTimestamp, .metadata.generation, .metadata.managedFields, .metadata.resourceVersion , .metadata.selfLink , .metadata.uid, .status)' > pull-secret_backup.json
```

In order to avoid errors with Docker Registry pull rate limits, you should add your Docker credentials to the Cluster.
This can occur especially with Rook/Ceph installation.

* Go to Secrets in Namespace `openshift-config`
* Open the `pull-secret`Secret
* Select `Actions`/`Edit Secret` 
* Scroll down and click `Add Credentials`
* Enter your Docker credentials

	![](./doc/pics/dockerpull.png)

* Click Save

If you already have Pods in ImagePullBackoff state then just delete them. They will recreate and should pull the image correctly.




<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 9.8 Monitor ElasticSearch Indexes

At any moment you can run `./tools/28_access_elastic.sh` in a separate terminal window.

This allows you to access ElasticSearch and gives you:

* ES User
* ES Password

	![](./doc/pics/es0.png)
	

### 9.8.1 Monitor ElasticSearch Indexes from Firefox

I use the [Elasticvue](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/elasticvue/) Firefox plugin.

Follow these steps to connects from Elasticvue:

- Select `Add Cluster` 
	![](./doc/pics/es1.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Put in the credentials and make sure you put `https` and not `http` in the URL
	![](./doc/pics/es2.png)
- Click `Test Connection` - you will get an error
- Click on the `https://localhost:9200` URL
	![](./doc/pics/es3.png)
	
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- This will open a new Tab, select `Accept Risk and Continue` 
	![](./doc/pics/es4.png)
- Cancel the login screen and go back to the previous tab
- Click `Connect` 
- You should now be connected to your AI Manager ElasticSearch instance 
	![](./doc/pics/es5.png)

# 10. Uninstall
---------------------------------------------------------------

❗ The scritps are coming from here [https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-samples.git](https://github.com/IBM/cp4waiops-samples.git)

If you run into problems check back if there have been some updates.


I have tested those on 3.1.1 as well and it seemed to work (was able to do a complete reinstall afterwards).

Just run:

```
./tools/99_uninstall/3.2/uninstall-cp4waiops.props
```





<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# 11. EventManager Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 11.1. Configure EventManager 🟢

❗ You only have to do this if you have installed EventManager/NOI (As described in Easy Install - Chapter 6). For basic demoing with AI MAnager this is not needed.




### 11.1.1 Create Kubernetes Observer for the Demo Applications 🟢

This is basically the same as for AI Manager as we need two separate instances of the Topology Manager. 


* In the `Event Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Administration`/`Topology Management`
* Under `Observer jobs` click `Configure`
* Click `Add new job`
* Under `Kubernetes`, click on `Configure`
* Choose `local` for `Connection Type`
* Set `Unique ID` to `robot-shop`
* Set `data_center` to `robot-shop`
* Under `Additional Parameters`
* Set `Terminated pods` to `true`
* Set `Correlate` to `true`
* Set Namespace to `robot-shop`
* Under `Job Schedule`
* Set `Time Interval` to 5 Minutes
* Click `Save`




### 11.1.2 Create REST Observer to Load Topologies 🟢

* In the `Event Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Administration`/`Topology Management`
* Under `Observer jobs` click `Configure`
* Click `Add new job`
* Under `REST`, click on `Configure`
* Choose `bulk_replace` for `Job Type`
* Set `Unique ID` to `listenJob` (important!)
* Set `Provider` to `listenJob` 
* Click `Save`







<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 11.1.3 🐥 Create Topology 🟢

##### Use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) - Option `52` for creating the Robot-Shop topology or use the manual procedure in chapter 4.5. 


❗ Please manually re-run the Kubernetes Observer to make sure that the merge has been done.



### 11.1.4 EventManager Webhook 🟢

Create Webhooks in EventManager for Event injection and incident simulation for the Demo.

The demo scripts (in the `demo` folder) give you the possibility to simulate an outage without relying on the integrations with other systems.

At this time it simulates:

- Git push event
- Log Events (Humio)
- Security Events (Falco)
- Instana Events
- Metric Manager Events (Predictive)
- Turbonomic Events
- CP4MCM Synthetic Selenium Test Events



<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


You have to define the following Webhook in EventManager (NOI): 

* `Administration` / `Integration with other Systems`
* `Incoming` / `New Integration`
* `Webhook`
* Name it `Demo Generic`
* Jot down the WebHook URL and copy it to the `NETCOOL_WEBHOOK_GENERIC` in the `./tools/01_demo/incident_robotshop-noi.sh`file
* Click on `Optional event attributes`
* Scroll down and click on the + sign for `URL`
* Click `Confirm Selections`


Use this json:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "1619706828000",
  "severity": "Critical",
  "summary": "Test Event",
  "nodename": "productpage-v1",
  "alertgroup": "robotshop",
  "url": "https://pirsoscom.github.io/grafana-robotshop.html"
}
```

Fill out the following fields and save:

* Severity: `severity`
* Summary: `summary`
* Resource name: `nodename`
* Event type: `alertgroup`
* Url: `url`
* Description: `"URL"`

Optionnally you can also add `Expiry Time` from `Optional event attributes` and set it to a convenient number of seconds (just make sure that you have time to run the demo before they expire.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 11.1.5 Create custom Filter and View in EventManager 🟢

#### 11.1.5.1 Filter 🟢

Duplicate the `Default` filter and set to global.

* Name: AIOPS
* Logic: **Any** (!)
* Filter:
	* AlertGroup = 'CEACorrelationKeyParent'
	* AlertGroup = 'robot-shop'

#### 11.1.5.2 View 🟢

Duplicate the `Example_IBM_CloudAnalytics` View and set to global.


* Name: AIOPS

Configure to your likings.


### 11.1.6 Create grouping Policy 🟢

* NetCool Web Gui --> `Insights` / `Scope Based Grouping`
* Click `Create Policy`
* `Action` select fielt `Alert Group`
* Toggle `Enabled` to `On`
* Save

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 11.1.7 Create EventManager/NOI Menu item - Open URL 🟢

in the Netcool WebGUI

* Go to `Administration` / `Tool Configuration`
* Click on `LaunchRunbook`
* Copy it (the middle button with the two sheets)
* Name it `Launch URL`
* Replace the Script Command with the following code

	```javascript
	var urlId = '{$selected_rows.URL}';
	
	if (urlId == '') {
	    alert('This event is not linked to an URL');
	} else {
	    var wnd = window.open(urlId, '_blank');
	}
	```
* Save

Then 

* Go to `Administration` / `Menu Configuration`
* Select `alerts`
* Click on `Modify`
* Move Launch URL to the right column
* Save

### 11.1.9.1 Create Merge Rules for Kubernetes Observer

Launch the following:

```bash
./52_load_robotshop_topology_eventmanager.sh
```

This will create:

- Merge Rules
- Merge Topologies for RobotShop.

❗ Please manually re-run the Kubernetes Observer to make sure that the merge has been done.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

---------------------------------------------------------------
# 12. Runbook Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 12.1 Configure Runbooks with AWX 🟢

This is the preferred method.

Use Option 🐥`23` in [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) to install an `AWX ` instance if you haven't done so yet.

# 13. Installing Turbonomic
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 13.1 Installing Turbonomic

Use Option 🐥`21` in [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install) to install a `Turbonomic` instance

## 13.2 Manually Installing Turbonomic

Only do this if you don't want to use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install)

> ℹ️ Either position the option in the configuratoion file or follow the steps described in this chapter.



You can install Turbonomic into the same cluster as CP4WAIOPS.

**❗ You need a license in order to use Turbonomic.**

1. Launch

	```bash
	ansible-playbook ./ansible/20_install-turbonomic.yaml
	```
2. Wait for the pods to come up
3. Open Turbonomic
4. Enter the license
5. Add the default target (local Kubernetes cluster is already instrumented with `kubeturbo`)

It can take several hours for the Supply Chain to populate, so be patient.

## 13.3 Installing kubeturbo

In order to get other Kubernetes clusters to show up in Turbonomic, you have to install `kubeturbo` (your main cluster is already registered).

1. Adapt `./ansible/templates/kubeturbo/my_kubeturbo_instance_cr.yaml` with the Turbonomic URL and the login
2. Launch

	```bash
	ansible-playbook ./ansible/20_1_aiops-addons-kubeturbo.yaml
	```
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 13.4 Turbo to WAIOPS Gateway

**❗This is not an officialy supported tool by any means and is still under heavy development!**

In order to push Turbonomic Actions into EventManager you can use my tool.
This tool needs existing `Business Applications`, you can either integrate with Instana (or other APMs) or create one under Settings/Topology.

1. Adapt the `./ansible/templates/turbo-gateway/create-turbo-gateway.yaml` file 

	| Variable | Default Value | Description |
	| -------- | ------------- | ----------- |
	|POLLING_INTERVAL| '300' | Poll every X seconds |
	|EVTMGR_SUMMARY_PREFIX| '[Turbonomic] ' | Prefix in the event summary |
	|EVTMGR_WEBHOOK_URL| netcool-evtmanager.apps.clustername.domain | EventManager hostname |
	|EVTMGR_WEBHOOK_PATH| /norml/xxxx | Webhook URL from EventManager (does not inclue the hostname, only `/norml/xxxx`) |
	|TURBO_API_URL| api-turbonomic.apps.clustername.domain | Turbonomic API URL |
	|TURBO_BA_NAME| 'RobotShop:robot-shop'| Turbonomic application name in the format APPNAME:ALERTGROUP. This links an EventManager alertgroup with an application |
	|ACTION_STATES| 'SUCCEEDED,FAILED,READY,IN_PROGRESS' | The list of ACTION_STATES to filter on |
	|ACTION_TYPES| 'MOVE,RESIZE_FOR_PERFORMANCE,RESIZE_FOR_EFFICIENCY,RESIZE' | The list of ACTION_TYPES to filter on |
	|DEBUG_ENABLED| 'false' | Enable additional log output |
	|ENTITY_TYPES| 'VirtualMachine,Application,PhysicalMachine,ContainerSpec,WorkloadController,Container' | The list of ENTITY_TYPES to filter on |
	|ACTION_START_TIME| '-30m'| Period of time in which actions are retrieved. E.g. -5m, -30m, -1h, -1d, -3d, -7d | 

2. Create Turbonomic Credentials Secret

	You can either:
	
	- create the secret from the command line (which will throw a warning for the already existing Secret when installing)
	
		```
		oc -n default create secret generic turbo-creds --from-literal=TURBO_USER=<youruser> --from-literal=TURBO_PWD=<yourpw>
		```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

	- replace the secret in the yaml file with
	
		```
		oc -n default create secret generic turbo-creds --from-literal=TURBO_USER=apiuser --from-literal=TURBO_PWD=turboadmin -o yaml --dry-run=client
		```


​	
3. Create Generic Webhook in EventManager/NOI with:

	```json
	{
	"timestamp": "1619706828000",
	"severity": "Critical",
	"summary": "Test Event",
	"nodename": "productpage-v1",
	"alertgroup": "robotshop",
	"url": "https://myturbo/something.html"
	}
	```
4. Launch 

	```shell
	ansible-playbook ./ansible/20_3_aiops-addons-turbonomic-gateway.yaml
	```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 13.5 Generate Metrics

**❗This is not an officialy supported tool by any means and is still under heavy development!**

If you have manually created a `Business Applications` you won't get any ResponseTime and Transactions metrics.
With this tool you can you can add randomized ResponseTime and Transactions metrics to the `Business Application` through the `Data Integration Framework (DIF)`.

> Note: The metrics pod can also serve metrics for other `Entity` types (businessApplication, businessTransaction, service, databaseServer, application)
> 
> Note: There is also a Route being created by the installer, so that you can test the URLs.
> 

1. Launch

	```shell
	ansible-playbook ./ansible/20_2_aiops-addons-turbonomic-metrics.yaml
	```

1. Wait for the Pod to become available
1. Add the DIF Target
	2. Go to `Settings/Target Configurations`
	2. Click `New Target`
	2. Select `Custom/DataIngestionFramework`
	2. Put in the URL for the metrics (see below) and a name
	2. Click `Add`
	3. Make sure that Target is green and reads `Validated`

It takes some time for the metrics to start showing up. Polling is every 10 minutes 

### 13.5.1 Test URL

You can use the following URL to test if everything is working:

`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/helloworld`

This will create a standalone `Business Application` called `Hello World` without any other `Entities` attached to it. 
But with metrics being ingested.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 13.5.2 Construct the URL

The URL has the format of:

```yaml
http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/<TYPE>/<NAME>/<UUID>
```

where:

- TYPE: Type of the `Entity` (businessApplication/businessTransaction/service/databaseServer/application)
- NAME: The name of the `Entity`
- UUID: The UUID that you can find under `Entity Information / Show All / Vendor ID`

So an example might be:
`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/service/Service-robot-shop%2Fcatalogue/b2d6fd52-c895-469e-bb98-2a791faefce7`
`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/businessApplication/RobotShop/285333133684640`
`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/businessTransaction/RobotShopCatalog/285333292080720`
`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/businessTransaction/RobotShoßpPayment/285333133684640`
`http://turbo-dif-service.default:3000/businessTransaction/RobotShopUser/285333133684640`

## 15.4 Live Humio integration with Event Manager


### 15.4.1 Create Humio Events Integration

Events integration is done via EventManager/NOI.

For the time being this only takes the first alert being pushed over (no way to handle arrays).
The native Humio integration seems to have a bug that gives "mergeAdvanced is not a function".


#### 15.4.1.1 On the EventManager/NOI side

Create a Webhook integration:

| Field  | Value  | 
|---|---|
| Severity|"Critical"|
| Summary|  alert.name|
| Resource name | events[0]."kubernetes.container_name"|
| Event type |   events[0]."kubernetes.namespace_name"|



With this sample payload:

```json
{
  "repository": "aiops",
  "timestamp": "2021-11-19T15:50:04.958Z",
  "alert": {
    "name": "test1",

#### 15.4.1.2 On Humio:

- Create Action:

	* Use the Webbhook from EventManager/NOI
	* Select `Skip Certificate Validation`
	* Click `Test Action` and check that you get it in EventManager/NOI Events

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

- Create Alert:

	* 	With Query (for example):
	
		```json
		"kubernetes.container_name" = ratings
		| @rawstring = /error/i
		```

	* 	Time Window 2 seconds
	* 	1 second throttle window
	* 	Add action from above
	
	

### 15.5 Easily simulate erros

Simulate MySQL error by cutting the communication with the Pod:

```bash
oc patch -n robot-shop service mysql -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"service": "mysql-deactivate"}}}'
```

Restore the communication:

```bash
oc patch -n robot-shop service mysql -p '{"spec": {"selector": {"service": "mysql"}}}'
```

# 18. Detailed Prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------------


## 18.1 OpenShift requirements

I installed the demo in a ROKS environment.

You'll need:

- ROKS 4.8 (4.7 should work also)
- 5x worker nodes Flavor `b3c.16x64` (so 16 CPU / 64 GB)

You might get away with less if you don't install some components (Humio, Turbonomic,...)



## 18.2 Tooling

You need the following tools installed in order to follow through this guide:

- ansible
- oc (4.7 or greater)
- jq
- kubectl (Not needed anymore - replaced by `oc`)
- kafkacat (only for training and debugging)
- elasticdump (only for training and debugging)
- IBM cloudctl (only for LDAP)

---------------------------------------------------------------



## 19.1 Manually install AI Manager (Optional)

Only do this if you don't want to use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install)



### 19..1.1 Adapt configuration

Adapt the `00_config_cp4waiops.yaml` file with the desired parameters:


#### 19.1.1.1 Automatic Login

The Playbook provides the means to automatically login to the cluster by filling out the following section of the config file:

```bash
# *************************************************************************************
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OCP LOGIN PARAMETERS
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# *************************************************************************************
OCP_LOGIN: true
OCP_URL: https://c100-e.eu-gb.containers.cloud.ibm.com:31513

### 19.1.2 Get the installation token

You can get the installation (pull) token from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the CP4WAIOPS images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

This token is being referred to as <PULL_SECRET_TOKEN> below and should look something like this (this is NOT a valid token):

```yaml
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3adsgJJQk0gTWFya2V0cGxhY2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzg0NzQzMjgsImp0aSI6IjRjYTM3gsdgdMzExNjQxZDdiMDJhMjRmMGMxMWgdsmZhIn0.Z-rqfSLJA-R-ow__tI3RmLx4mssdggdabvdcgdgYEkbYY  
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 19.1.3 🚀 Start installation

Just run:

```bash
./10_install_ai_manager.sh -t <PULL_SECRET_TOKEN> [-v true]


Example:
./10_install_ai_manager.sh -t eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3adsgJJQk0gTWFya2V0cGxhY2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzg0NzQzMjgsImp0aSI6IjRjYTM3gsdgdMzExNjQxZDdiMDJhMjRmMGMxMWgdsmZhIn0.Z-rqfSLJA-R-ow__tI3RmLx4mssdggdabvdcgdgYEkbYY
```

This will install:


- CP4WAIOPS AI Manager
- OpenLDAP (if enabled)
- Demo Apps (if enabled)
- Register LDAP Users (if enabled)
- Housekeeping
	- Additional Routes (Topology, Flink)
	- Create OCP User (serviceaccount demo-admin)
	- Patch Ingress
	- Adapt NGINX Certificates
	- Adapt Slack Welcome message to /welcome
- Turbonomic (if enabled)
- Humio (if enabled)
- OCP ELK Stack (if enabled)
- AWX (Open Source Ansible Tower - if enabled)
- ManageIQ (Open Source CloudForms - if enabled)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### 19.1.4 Configure LDAP Users

1. Log in to AI Manager as admin
2. Select `Administration/Access` control from the "Hamburger manu"
3. Click on the `Identity provider configuration` (upper right) you should get the LDAP being registered
4. Go back
5. Select `User Groups Tab`
6. Click `New User Group`
7. Call it `demo`
8. Click `Next`
9. Click on `Identity provider groups`
10. Search for `demo`
11. Select `cn=demo,ou=Groups,dc=ibm,dc=com`
12. Click `Next`
13. Select `Administrator` rights
14. Click `Next`
15. Click `Create`

Now you will be able to login with all LDAP users that are part of the demo group (for example demo/P4ssw0rd!).

You can check/modify those in the OpenLDAPAdmin interface that you can access with the credentials described in 3.3.





<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>



## 19.3 Manually install EventManager (Optional)

Only do this if you don't want to use 🐥 [Easy Install](#-2-easy-install)



### 19.3.1 Get the installation token

You can get the installation (pull) token from [https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary](https://myibm.ibm.com/products-services/containerlibrary).

This allows the CP4WAIOPS images to be pulled from the IBM Container Registry.

This token is being referred to as <PULL_SECRET_TOKEN> below and should look something like this (this is NOT a valid token):

```yaml
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3adsgJJQk0gTWFya2V0cGxhY2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzg0NzQzMjgsImp0aSI6IjRjYTM3gsdgdMzExNjQxZDdiMDJhMjRmMGMxMWgdsmZhIn0.Z-rqfSLJA-R-ow__tI3RmLx4mssdggdabvdcgdgYEkbYY  
```

To get the token, see [here](#3.1.2-get-the-installation-token) 



### 19.3.2 🚀 Start installation

Just run:

```bash
./11_install_event_manager.sh -t <PULL_SECRET_TOKEN> [-v true]


Example:
./11_install_event_manager.sh -t eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJpc3adsgJJQk0gTWFya2V0cGxhY2UiLCJpYXQiOjE1Nzg0NzQzMjgsImp0aSI6IjRjYTM3gsdgdMzExNjQxZDdiMDJhMjRmMGMxMWgdsmZhIn0.Z-rqfSLJA-R-ow__tI3RmLx4mssdggdabvdcgdgYEkbYY
```

This will install:

- CP4WAIOPS EventManager
- Gateway





<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


## 19.4 Get Passwords and Credentials

At any moment you can run `./tools/20_get_logins.sh` that will print out all the relevant passwords and credentials.

Usually it's a good idea to store this in a file for later use:

```bash
./tools/20_get_logins.sh > my_credentials.txt
```

## 19.5 Check status of installation

At any moment you can run `./tools/11_check_install.sh` or for a more in-depth examination and troubleshooting `./tools/10_debug_install.sh` and select `Option 1` to check your installation.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

# 20. Additional Configuration
---------------------------------------------------------------

## 20.1 Setup remote Kubernetes Observer



### 20.1.1. Get Kubernetes Cluster Access Details

As part of the kubernetes observer, it is required to communicate with the target cluster. So it is required to have the URL and Access token details of the target cluster. 

Do the following.


#### 20.1.1.1. Login

Login into the remote Kubernetes cluster on the Command Line.

#### 20.1.1.2. Access user/token 


Run the following:

```
./tools/97_addons/k8s-remote/remote_user.sh
```

This will create the remote user if it does not exist and print the access token (also if you have already created).

Please jot this down.



### 20.1.1. Create Kubernetes Observer Connection



* In the `AI Manager` "Hamburger" Menu select `Operate`/`Data and tool integrations`
* Click `Add connection`
* Under `Kubernetes`, click on `Add Integration`
* Click `Connect`
* Name it `RobotShop`
* Data Center `demo`
* Click `Next`
* Choose `Load` for Connection Type
* Input the URL you have gotten from the step above in `Kubernetes master IP address` (without the https://)
* Input the port for the URL you have gotten from the step above in `Kubernetes API port`
* Input the `Token` you have gotten from the step above
* Set `Trust all certificates by bypassing certificate verification` to `On`
* Set `Hide pods that have been terminated` to `On`
* Set `Correlate analytics events on the namespace groups created by this job` to `On`
* Set Namespace to `robot-shop`
* Click `Next`
* Click `Done`


![](./doc/pics/k8s-remote.png)



## 20.2 AiManager Event Gateway

A Simple Webhook to Kafka Gateway for CP4WAIOPS.
This allows you to push generic JSON to AIManager Events throught a Webhook into Kafka.

> Source code is included if you want to mess around a bit.


### 20.2.1 Message mapping Parameters

Those Strings define how the message is being decoded.

To adapt the mapping parameters to your needs, you have to modify in the `cp4waiops-event-gateway-config` ConfigMap in file `./tools/97_addons/webhook/create-cp4mcm-event-gateway.yaml`.


The following paramters have to be mapped:

```yaml
ITERATE_ELEMENT: 'events'
NODE_ELEMENT: 'kubernetes.container_name'
ALERT_ELEMENT: 'kubernetes.namespace_name'
SUMMARY_ELEMENT: '@rawstring'
TIMESTAMP_ELEMENT: '@timestamp'
URL_ELEMENT: 'none'
SEVERITY_ELEMENT: '5'
MANAGER_ELEMENT: 'KafkaWebhook'
```

1. The `ITERATE_ELEMENT` is the element of the Message that we iterate over.
	This means that the Gateway will get the `ITERATE_ELEMENT`element and iterate, map and push all messages in the array.
1. The sub-elements that will be mapped for each element in the array are:

	- Node
	- AlertGroup
	- Summary
	- URL
	- Severity
	- Manager
	- Timestamp

> Any element that cannot be found will be defaulted by the indicated value.
> Example for Severity: If we put the mapping value "5" in the config, this probably won't correspond to a JSON key and the severity for all messages is forced to 5.

### 20.2.2 Getting the Kafka Conncetion Parameters

This gives you the Parameters for the Kafka Connection that you have to modify in the `cp4waiops-event-gateway-config` ConfigMap in file `./tools/97_addons/webhook/create-cp4mcm-event-gateway.yaml`.

```bash
export WAIOPS_NAMESPACE=cp4waiops
export KAFKA_TOPIC=$(oc get kafkatopics -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE | grep -v cp4waiopscp4waiops| grep cp4waiops-cartridge-alerts-$EVENTS_TYPE| awk '{print $1;}')
export KAFKA_USER=$(oc get secret ibm-aiops-kafka-secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE --template={{.data.username}} | base64 --decode)
export KAFKA_PWD=$(oc get secret ibm-aiops-kafka-secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE --template={{.data.password}} | base64 --decode)
export KAFKA_BROKER=$(oc get routes iaf-system-kafka-0 -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE -o=jsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}{"\n"}'):443
export CERT_ELEMENT=$(oc get secret -n $WAIOPS_NAMESPACE kafka-secrets  -o 'go-template={{index .data "ca.crt"}}'| base64 -d)

echo "KAFKA_BROKER: '"$KAFKA_BROKER"'"
echo "KAFKA_USER: '"$KAFKA_USER"'"
echo "KAFKA_PWD: '"$KAFKA_PWD"'"
echo "KAFKA_TOPIC: '"$KAFKA_TOPIC"'"
echo "CERT_ELEMENT:  |- "
echo $CERT_ELEMENT

```

> You will have to indent the Certificate!



### 20.2.2 Deploying 

```bash
oc apply -n default -f ./tools/97_addons/k8s-remote/create-cp4mcm-event-gateway.yaml

oc get route -n cp4waiops cp4waiops-event-gateway  -o jsonpath={.spec.host}

```


### 20.2.3 Using the Webhook

For the following example we will iterate over the `events` array and epush them to mapped version to Kafka:


```bash
curl -X "POST" "http://cp4waiops-event-gateway-cp4waiops.itzroks-270003bu3k-azsa8n-6ccd7f378ae819553d37d5f2ee142bd6-0000.us-south.containers.appdomain.cloud/webhook" \

# 21. Service Now integration
---------------------------------------------------------------



## 21.1 Integration 

1. Follow [this](./doc/servicenow/snow-Integrate.md) document to get and configure your Service Now Dev instance with CP4WAIOPS.
	Stop at `Testing the ServiceNow Integration`. 
	❗❗Don’t do the training as of yet.
2. Import the Changes from ./doc/servicenow/import_change.xlsx
	1. Select `Change - All` from the right-hand menu
	2. Right Click on `Number`in the header column
	3. Select Import
	![](./doc/pics/snow3.png)
	3. Chose the ./doc/servicenow/import_change.xlsx file and click `Upload`
	![](./doc/pics/snow4.png)
	3. Click on `Preview Imported Data`
	![](./doc/pics/snow5.png)
	3. Click on `Complete Import` (if there are errors or warnings just ignore them and import anyway)
	![](./doc/pics/snow6.png)
	
3. Import the Incidents from ./doc/servicenow/import_incidents.xlsx
	1. Select `Incidents - All` from the right-hand menu
	2. Proceed as for the Changes but for Incidents
	
4. Now you can finish configuring your Service Now Dev instance with CP4WAIOPS by [going back](./doc/servicenow/snow-Integrate.md#testing-the-servicenow-integration) and continue whre you left off at `Testing the ServiceNow Integration`.
